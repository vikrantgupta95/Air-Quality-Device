# Air-Quality-Device
This is a sensor and controller based device with alert system to tell the user about the quality of air in a closed environment by taking samples if that and evaluating the same and displaying that on a display as well and creating alert if in case of any hazard situation.

To measure the air quality in the apartment, this air quality monitoring system can be used. This air quality detector not only measures the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) level in the air, but also measures the level of humidity and temperature both inside the room and outside environment. This project consists of two sensors namely, temperature cum humidity sensor and CO2 sensor. These sensors are attached with the system inside the room to calculate the room temperature, humidity and CO2 and also on the roof of the house to calculate the atmosphere temperature, humidity and CO2. It also has LCD attached to it which displays the value of the temperature, humidity and CO2 levels measured.
